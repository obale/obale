### [Short Bio][website]

Alex Oberhauser is a tech-entrepreneur, innovator and former C-level executive.
During his entrepreneurial journey he acquired a multitude of skills and
expertise that go far beyond his original core fields of computer science and
software engineering.

His main expertise centers around bringing innovative products, that solve
concrete customer pain points, to the market. This includes also markets that
are highly regulated and hard to penetrate.

He is currently working on user controlled identities and the empowerment of
the end-users, with privacy and security as part of the value proposition,
not as an afterthought.
